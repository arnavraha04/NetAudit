**NetAudit**

 NetAudit is a network auditing and monitoring tool designed to analyze network security, detect vulnerabilities, and provide detailed insights into connected devices. This project demonstrates hands-on knowledge  of network scanning, auditing, and security best practices.

## Project Features

-Comprehensive Network Scanning – Scan a target IP address or domain to assess network availability.

-Multiple Scan Techniques – Supports SYN, TCP Connect, UDP, and Ping scans for flexible analysis.

-Port and Service Identification – Detects open ports and the services running on them.

-Basic Risk Assessment – Provides risk levels and descriptions for detected services to highlight potential security concerns.

-Interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI) – Simple and user-friendly interface for efficient network auditing.

## Installation

   1) Clone the repository:
    
            git clone https://github.com/arnavraha04/NetAudit.git
